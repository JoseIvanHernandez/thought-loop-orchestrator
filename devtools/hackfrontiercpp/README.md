# ðŸ“¦ Borland C++ 5.02 Setup (Legacy Dev Tools)

This folder documents the setup, environment, and integration path for the Borland C++ 5.02 IDE and OWL (ObjectWindows Library 5.0), preserved for use in this hybrid file auditing project.

## ðŸ”— ISO Source

- **Borland C++ 5.02 ISO (WinWorld)**  
  ðŸ“Ž https://winworldpc.com/download/35c2be17-78c3-8cc3-8e11-c3a6c2bb2a52  
  *(Educational/archival use only â€“ not included in repo)*

## ðŸ“¦ Full Environment Backup

To streamline setup across lab or virtual machines, this repo includes a ZIP archive (`bcc_bc5.zip`) of the **entire working Borland IDE** environment. While the original ISO is ~175MB across floppies, this snapshot ensures:

- No missing tools or headers
- OWL library and Help files intact
- Fast deployment without manual installs

> This archive is synced from a working lab machine where Borland was fully installed and tested.
